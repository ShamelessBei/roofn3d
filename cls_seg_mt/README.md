# PointNet.pytorch
This repo is implementation application of PointNEt on RoofN3D dataset.

For Pointnet details, please look here:
1. PointNet(https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593) in pytorch. The model is in `pointnet.py`.
2. The code has been taken from here: https://github.com/fxia22/pointnet.pytorch

# INSTRUCTIONS
## Classification
### training
1. download the data from https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JRKiO8_SOjoz6lqUK819-9cpO0Ag2Yr1
2. Unzip it into a folder
3. Change the data folder in the train_classification.py
4. run train_classification.py
### testing
1. run the test_cls.py with appropriate data folder.
